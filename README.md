# Nxt Trendz - Cart Features

Here are some cart features for your NxtTrendz project, which is an E-Commerce Clone inspired by Amazon and Flipkart:

### NxtTrendz Cart Features:

1. **Add to Cart Functionality**:
   - Users can add products to the cart from the product details page.
   - Each product added is stored in the cart, which can be viewed and managed on the cart page.

2. **Remove from Cart**:
   - Users can remove individual items from the cart.
   - Items can be removed either by a "Remove" button or directly from the cart summary page.

3. **Update Item Quantity**:
   - Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items in their cart.
   - The total price will update based on the quantity of each item.

4. **Cart Persistence with Local Storage**:
   - The cart is stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, allowing users to retain items even if they leave the page or refresh it.
   - The cart will also persist across sessions until the user logs out or clears the local storage.

5. **Cart Summary**:
   - The cart page will display a summary of the items added, showing product names, quantities, and total price.
   - It will also show the total cost of all items in the cart, and any applicable discounts.


These features will enhance the shopping experience on your NxtTrendz e-commerce platform. Let me know if you need help implementing any of these features!

<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>

The app must have the following functionalities:

- **Feature 1**: 
  - When an unauthenticated user tries to access the **Cart** Route, they should be navigated to the **Login** Route.
  
- **Feature 2**: 
  - When an authenticated user tries to add the same product multiple times, the quantity of the product should be updated accordingly, and the cart item count in the header should remain the same.
  
- **Feature 3**: 
  - The total amount and number of items in the cart should be displayed in the **Cart** Route.
  - When the plus icon is clicked, the quantity of the product should be incremented by one.
  - When the minus icon is clicked, the quantity of the product should be decremented by one.
  - When the quantity of the product is one and the minus icon is clicked, the respective product should be removed from the cart.
  - Based on the quantity of the product, the product price and the total cost should be updated.

- **Feature 4**: 
  - When an authenticated user clicks on the **remove** button, the respective cart item should be removed.

- **Feature 5**: 
  - When an authenticated user clicks on the **Remove All** button, all cart items should be removed, and an **Empty Cart View** should be displayed.

The `CartContext` has an object as a value with the following properties:
- `cartList`: stores the cart items.
- `removeAllCartItems`: removes all items from the cart list.
- `addCartItem`: adds a product to the cart list.
- `removeCartItem`: removes a product from the cart list.
- `incrementCartItemQuantity`: increases the quantity of a product.
- `decrementCartItemQuantity`: decreases the quantity of a product.

### Implementation Files

Use these files to complete the implementation:

- `src/App.js`
- `src/components/Cart/index.js`
- `src/components/Cart/index.css`
- `src/components/CartItem/index.js`

### Quick Tips

<details>
<summary>Click to view</summary>

- The `line-height` CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text:

  ```css
  line-height: 1.5;
  ```

- The `find()` array method returns the first item's value that satisfies the provided testing function. If no item is found, it returns `undefined`:

  **Syntax**: `arr.find(Testing Function)`

</details>

### Important Note

<details>

- **Icons**: 
  - `BsPlusSquare`, `BsDashSquare` icons from `react-icons` should be used for **plus** and **minus** buttons in the cart item.
  - `AiFillCloseCircle` icon from react-icons should be used for the **remove** button in the cart item.
  
- **Test Attributes**: 
  - The Cart Item should consist of two HTML button elements with `data-testid` attribute values as **plus** and **minus**, respectively.
  - The Cart Item should consist of an HTML button element with `data-testid` attribute values as **remove**.

- **Product Image**: 
  - The product image in **Cart Item** Route should have the `alt` as the `title` of the product.

- **Prime User Credentials**:
  ```text
   username: rahul
   password: rahul@2021
  ```
